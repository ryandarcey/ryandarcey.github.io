			<!-- <h1>About Me</h1> -->
			<img class="me" src="./files/ryandarcey.jpg" />
			<p>
				I am a recent graduate from WPI, a game developer, software developer,
				as well as a gamer and musician, just to name a few.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the biggest reasons why I love making games and software is collaborating
				with people of different disciplines and perspectives to create something
				new and exciting.
				Some of my favorite game genres to play and make are shooters,
				roguelikes, strategy games, and (both physical and digital) card games.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've made games with Unity, Unreal 4 and 5, and Godot 4.
				<mark>Other technically-related things i like (and why?)</mark>
