						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>
							Robot Rampage is a multi-perspective, retro-style shooter.
							Playing as Gompei the goat, you must fend off rogue robots roaming
							the massive tunnel network underneath campus.
						</p>
						<p>
							Robot Rampage was developed as part of research about
							the effects of latency and jitter on user experience in 
							cloud game streaming. It was designed with multiple perspectives 
							and other varying parameters to change aspects of difficulty.
							The game was used in a user study looking at how combinations
							of these certain game elements and different amounts of latency and jitter
							impacted the users experience while playing.
						</p>
						<p>
							The design process for Robot Rampage was more intensive and front-loaded than 
							you might expect of a game of this scope. This is because we had to accomodate
							many different highly specific constraints for the purpose of the user study,
							making sure it would be effective for gathering relevant data.
						</p>
						<p>
							After research and design, some of the main things
							I was responsible for during development include:
							<ul>
								<li>Endless procedural map generation</li>
								<li>Switching between first-person, third-person, and overhead camera perspectives</li>
								<li>Reading and loading game settings from JSON files</li>
								<li>Recording and saving relevant gameplay data to files</li>
								<li>Designing and importing rooms from Blender</li>
								<li>Integrating different levels of difficulty</li>
								<li>Integrating pre-made 3D models, textures, and animations</li>

						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>
							Planet of the Ants is a real-time, isometric strategy game, 
							where you control a colony of ants as it gathers resources, makes units, 
							and expands. Fight against another colony until you kill their Queen,
							or they kill yours! The game takes place in a hex-tile-based map with
							each side having access to several types of units and buildings that
							generate different resources used to recruit more units.
						</p>
						<p>
							The game design was largely a collaborative effort by our five team members
							(two artists and three programmers).
							I was responsible for most of the AI systems such as implementing
							pathfinding, many of the unit interactions, and opponent behavior.
							I also integrated many of the art assets into the game and helped resolve
							many of the technical issues related to importing and using assets in Unreal 4.

						</p>

						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>
							Death Spell is a fast-paced card game for 2-4 players, where 2 teams of
							adventurers have been cursed with a volatile spell and must compete to
							stay alive. Players pass around the death spell as it counts down 
							every turn. Each player has a unique ability as well as cards they can
							play from a shared deck. You win if your team avoids death while the 
							opposing team succumbs to the spell.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our team of four members collaborated on all the elements of game design 
							and iteration via extensive playtesting. 
							For the actual production, I helped to create and refine the full rules,
							and I visually designed and made many of the final cards using Photoshop.

						</p>

						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>
							Over the course of 7 weeks, I worked in a team with nine other students 
							using agile methodology throughout 4 major sprints. We also held daily
							scrums and created and assigned user stories at the beginning of each sprint.
						</p>
						<p>
							The application was intended primarily to be used on kiosks at the 
							Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital and contains three major components
							which were influenced by surveys and interviews of potential users:
							<ul>
								<li>
									A pathfinding system that shows users the fastest route to
									their chosen destination.
								</li>
								<li>
									A map editor allowing hospital admins to add, edit, or delete
									locations from the existing map.
								</li>
								<li>
									A request service that allows employees to request 
									hospital services when and where necessary.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							The app also contains several more features and extensions of the 
							above core features. These include a sharing feature, allowing 
							users to text or email the route to themselves or scan a QR code,
							and a protype thermometer integration to check if a patient has a 
							fever before entering the hostpital.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some key components I was responsible for include:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Gathering user studies and creating user stories at the beginning
									of each sprint.
								</li>
								<li>Creating and integrating several pathfinding 
									algorithms into the route finder.
								</li>
								<li>Implementing most features of the map editor (displaying nodes, adding, editing, 
									and deleting nodes and edges, etc.).
								</li>
								<li>Implementing most features of the route finder 
									(entering the user's location and destination,
									displaying the route on the map,
									zooming and panning of the map,
									displaying different floors, etc.).
								</li>
								<li>The addition of a 'dino game' for the user to play
									while waiting for approval to enter the hospital.
								</li>
							</ul>

						</p>

						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>
							This project aimed to create a machine learning model that could accurately
							classify 30-second clips of songs into one of 10 genres. We used two different
							methods of extracting features from the song data.
							The first was numerical features (38 commonly cited numerical aspects
							of music such as zero-crossing rate, spectral centroid,
							and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), while the second was
							creating a Mel-Spectrogram from each song clip.
						</p>
						<p>
							Using ~1600 30-second song clips from Spotify as our data set,
							we made a number of models (including KNN, Random Forest, and XGB)
							on the numerical data, with the XGB model achieving 90.7% accuracy.
							Then, with the Mel-Spectrogram images, we trained a CNN as an image
							classifier, essentially categorizing the songs by the visual characteristics
							that appeared in the Mel-Spectrograms, which achieved between
							91% and 95% cross-validation accuracy.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to researching approaches and good candidates for features, 
							I was primarily responsible for both turning the song clips into usable
							Mel-Spectrograms, as well as creating, training, and adjusting the CNN used to
							classify those spectrograms.
