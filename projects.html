						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>
							Robot Rampage is a multi-perspective, retro-style shooter.
							Playing as Gompei the goat, you must fend off rogue robots roaming
							the massive tunnel network underneath campus.
						</p>
						<p>
							Robot Rampage was developed as part of research about
							the effects of latency and jitter on user experience in 
							cloud game streaming. It was designed with multiple perspectives 
							and other varying parameters to change aspects of difficulty.
							The game was used in a user study looking at how combinations
							of these certain game elements and different amounts of latency and jitter
							impacted the users experience while playing.
						</p>
						<p>
							Initially, the research and early design was done by our entire team, 
							and we were helped by our advisor and a PhD student.
							The design process for Robot Rampage was more intensive and front-loaded than 
							you might expect of a game of this scope as we had to accomodate
							many different highly specific constraints for the purpose of the user study.
						</p>
						<p>
							With only two of us then developing the game -- and both of us being programmers --
							we both worked on most aspects of the game to some degree. Some of the main
							things I focused on include:
							<ul>
								<li>endless procedural map generation</li>
								<li>switching between first-person, third-person, and overhead camera perspectives</li>
								<li>reading and loading game settings from JSON files</li>
								<li>recording and saving relevant gameplay data to files</li>
								<li>designing and importing rooms from Blender</li>
								<li>integrating different levels of difficulty</li>
								<li>integrating pre-made 3D models, textures, and animations</li>

							<strong>Developed:</strong> March - May 2022

							<strong>Tools Used:</strong>

								<li>Unreal Engine 4</li>
								<li>Perforce</li>

						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>
							Planet of the Ants is a real-time, isometric strategy game, 
							where you control a colony of ants as it gathers resources, makes units, 
							and expands. Fight against another colony until you kill their Queen,
							or they kill yours! The game takes place in a hex-tile-based map with
							each side having access to several types of units and buildings that
							generate different resources used to recruit more units.
						</p>
						<p>
							The game design was largely a collaborative effort by our five team members.
							The team consisted of two artists and three programmers (including myself).
							I was primarily responsible for most of the AI systems such as implementing
							pathfinding, many of the unit interactions, and opponent behavior, as well
							as helping to integrate many of the art assets into the game and helping resolve
							many of the technical issues related to importing and using assets in Unreal 4.

						</p>

						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>
							Death Spell is a fast-paced card game for 2-4 players, where 2 teams of
							adventurers have been cursed with a volatile spell and must compete to
							stay alive. Players pass around the death spell as it counts down 
							every turn. Each player has a unique ability as well as cards they can
							play from a shared deck. You win if your team avoids death while the 
							opposing team succumbs to the spell.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our team of four members collaborated on all the elements of game design 
							and iteration via extensive playtesting. For the actual production I 
							helped to create and refine the full rules and I was primarily
							responsible for visually designing and making many of the final cards 
							in Photoshop.

						</p>

						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>
							This project aimed to create a machine learning model that could accurately
							classify 30-second clips of songs into one of 10 genres. We used two different
							methods of extracting features from the song data.
							The first was numerical features (38 commonly cited numerical aspects
							of music such as zero-crossing rate, spectral centroid,
							and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), while the second was
							creating a Mel-Spectrogram from each song clip.
						</p>
						<p>
							Using ~1600 30-second song clips from Spotify as our data set,
							we made a number of models (including KNN, Random Forest, and XGB)
							on the numerical data, with the XGB model achieving 90.7% accuracy.
							Then, with the Mel-Spectrogram images, we trained a CNN as an image
							classifier, essentially categorizing the songs by the visual characteristics
							that appeared in the Mel-Spectrograms, which achieved between
							91% and 95% cross-validation accuracy.
						</p>
						<p>
							After researching approaches and good candidates for features, I was primarily
							responsible for both turning the song clips into usable Mel-Spectrograms,
							as well as creating, training, and adjusting the CNN used to
							classify those spectrograms.
